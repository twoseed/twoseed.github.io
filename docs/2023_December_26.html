<p>Alhamdulillah. Today was a great day. I woke up early in the morning. I studied biology. I spent my time from 5 pm to 9 pm in the mosque. Alhamdulillah. Our beloved sir named Momtaj discussed the purpose of life, the purpose of tabligh and a lot more. Tabligh jamat that came to our mosque Saturday left today. May Allah grant them barakah in their life and guide us all. (Amen). Finally, I spent some time with Abdullah and Abdur Rahman. There, We discussed our study.</p>
