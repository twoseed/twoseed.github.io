<p>Today is Monday and Alhamdulillah! Today was such a great day. All though I woke up late today, my intention was to wake up early. I think that I need to focus on my sleeping schedule, and Alhamdulillah! I have already planned that. I will try to sleep before 11:00 P.M. Today, I had a plan to read biology book. But Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to do that. I also had a plan to repay my debt. I wasn&#39;t able to pay before because I had not had money in my Nagad, a Mobile banking Application, account. Alhamdulillah! I have cashed in some money to my Nagad account and I will soon repay my debt. Today, I met one of my brother named Abdur Rahman who currently lives in Rajshahi. There was a gathering in Bonani Mosque in where we gathered and listened to the Imam. Our Imam was Ismail Hossein, who is the head of <em>Tafsirul Quran</em> sector in <em>Jamiul Ulum Bogura</em>. He discussed about the value of young life and how precise a young life is! He also emphasized the value of time. He discussed all of these with the help of Al Quran. Alhamdulillah! It was a great and important discussion. There was a <em>tabligh jamat</em> attending in that mosque. They served the present people of that mosque with puffed rice, biscuits, guava pieces and some sweet crackers. I was satisfied to eat those. After that I came back to home but Abdullah stayed there to help out the brothers from <em>tabligh jamat</em> to show them Student dormitories. </p>
