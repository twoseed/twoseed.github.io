<p>Today is Friday and Alhamdulillah! It was a beautiful day. I have installed a new linux distribution. To be more precise, It wasn&#39;t a new distribution. It was the same distribution with different Desktop Environment. Previously I had installed Linux mint with Xfce DE. Now I have installed Linux mint with Cinnamon DE. A new year is coming. I can say it is a preparation for new year&#39;s humble beginning. I also customized my VScode theme and some other tools that I use in everyday.</p>
<p>My programming target for the NEW YEAR:</p>
<ul>
<li>rust programming language</li>
<li>data structure</li>
<li>news application</li>
</ul>
<p>I also hope that I could write more delegant, express-full journal and make a habit of writing that daily. Wish me luck!</p>
