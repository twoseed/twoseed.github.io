Today is Friday and Alhamdulillah! It was a beautiful day. I have revised some trigonometry concept. I revised some of my previously learnt english grammar. I did the homework of Mithu sir on the topic of Verbal. I gave some of my time to one of younger brother named Shihab and another brother Abdullah. We discussed about atheism, barometer and islamophobic people. Brother Abdullah gave us new information about islamophobic people and the history of islamophobia. I talked about atheism. Brother Shihab talked about barometer. Our discussion was random but fun.
