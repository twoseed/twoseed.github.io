# 29 December 2023
Today is Friday and Alhamdulillah! It was a beautiful day. I have installed a new linux distribution. To be more precise, It wasn't a new distribution. It was the same distribution with different Desktop Environment. Previously I had installed Linux mint with Xfce DE. Now I have installed Linux mint with Cinnamon DE. A new year is coming. I can say it is a preparation for new year's humble beginning. I also customized my VScode theme and some other tools that I use in everyday.

My programming target for the NEW YEAR:
- rust programming language
- data structure
- news application

I also hope that I could write more delegant, express-full journal and make a habit of writing that daily. Wish me luck!
